# stingy TODO List

> **Before adding a new item:** Search this list for similar existing bugs/features first.
> If a matching item already exists, increment the attempt count (e.g. `(attempted x2)`) and append
> notes about what was tried. Notify the user that this has been attempted before so we can
> try a different approach. This helps track repeated failures on the same issue.
>
> **Workflow:** Open -> Needs Verification -> Done (or back to Open if verification fails).
> Items in "Needs Verification" must be tested before being re-attempted or marked done.
> **When completing items:** Always move to "Needs Verification" first -- NEVER mark as Done directly.
> Only the user can promote items from Needs Verification -> Done (moved to archive) after testing.
>
> **Auto-verification (run as part of every todolist update):**
> When displaying or updating the todolist, automatically verify Needs Verification items where possible:
> - **Code exists**: grep/read the mentioned file to confirm the described change is present
> - **Migration applied**: check `.migration-status` for the migration filename
> - **Function deployed**: check `.function-status` for the function name and recent timestamp
> - **Build compiles**: confirm from recent build output
> - **Tests exist**: check if test files cover the feature
> Items that pass auto-verification get marked `(auto-verified YYYY-MM-DD)`. Items that require
> manual/device testing (UI behavior, UX flows, on-device WiFi) stay as-is for user verification.
>
> **Display rules (when user asks to view the todolist):**
> 1. Make sure all entries are up to date first (move completed items, update counts)
> 2. Run auto-verification on all Needs Verification items
> 3. Show each item individually in useful groups (Bugs, Improvements, Features)
> 4. Number each item with **globally unique numbers** across all sections (e.g. Needs Verification 1-12, Open 13-21) so the user can unambiguously reference any item by number
>
> **Timestamps:** Append date tags to track item lifecycle: `(added YYYY-MM-DD)`, `(verified YYYY-MM-DD)`, `(done YYYY-MM-DD)`, `(reopened YYYY-MM-DD)`.
>
> **Archive:** Completed items are in [todolist-archive.md](todolist-archive.md).
